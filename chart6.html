<h1 align="left">Conclusion</h1>
<p>From the above, we can conclude that there are 2 factors that can explain the change of Lung/Bronchus Cancer Rate during the past 4 decades, Life Expectancy and Smoking.</p>
<p>There is a increase of life expectancy during the past 4 decades, which may contribute to the increase of Lung/Bronchus Cancer Rate.</p>
<p>However, the change of Smoking habit plays a even more important role. The odds of getting Lung/Bronchus Cancer among heavy smokers will be many times higher than non-smoker.<br>
Also, as there is a delayed effect (around 20 years) between Smoking and Lung/Bronchus Cancer, we saw that there is around 20-30 years gap between the peak year of Smoking Rate and peak year of Lung/Bronchus Cancer.
<p>So what kind of suggestions can we provide?</p>
<p>Needless to say, First:<br>
<b>NO Smoking!</b></p>
<p>Second:<br>
For those over 40 years old, take regular <b>health check</b>, especially those over 65!</p>
